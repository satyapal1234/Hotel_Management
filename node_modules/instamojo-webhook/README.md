# instamojo-webhook
instamojo webhook handling and verification library for Express js Middleware <br />
## Installation

This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the
[npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). Installation is done using the
[`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

```bash
$ npm install instamojo-webhook
```

## API

```js
var instamojoWebhook = require('instamojo-webhook')
```

### instamojoWebhook(options)
Create a webhook middleware with the given `options`.

#### Options

`instamojo-webhook` accepts secret salt provided Instamojo Developers page in the options object.

```js
instamojoWebhook({ secretKey: 'Your Secret SALT provided by instamojo'});
```

### req.instamojo

To store or access instamojo payment data, simply use the request property `req.instamojo`,
which is (generally) serialized as JSON , so nested objects
are typically fine. For example :

```js
var express = require("express");
var app = express();
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
var instamojoWebhook = require("instamojo-webhook");

app.use(bodyParser());
var instamojoMiddleWare = instamojoWebhook({ secretKey: 'Your Secret Salt provided by Instamojo'});

app.post("/",instamojoMiddleWare,function(req,res){
  console.log(req.instamojo);
  res.send("hello");
})

```

##Why this Module ?

I've written blog post for handling instamojo webhook - [link](http://www.i-visionblog.com/2015/08/working-with-instamojo-payment-integration-for-mobile-and-web-apps.html "Blog post").
